# unity-debug-panel

'DebugPanel.unitypackage' contains a very simple prefab, essentially an in-game UI with some text fields, to which you can write debug messages. It is designed to be dropped directly into your Unity scene, and exists in World Space, continually facing the Main Camera. This makes it useful for displaying debug messages while play testing XR experiences.

### Installation
1. Open your Unity project.
2. Navigate to "Assets" > "Import Package" > "Custom Package" in the Unity Editor.
3. Select the downloaded 'DebugPanel.unitypackage' file and click "Open".
4. In the Import dialog, check the assets you want to import and click "Import".
