# unity-debug-panel

'DebugPanel.unitypackage' contains a very simple prefab, essentially an in-game UI with some text fields, which displays Debug.Log messages. It is designed to be dropped directly into your Unity scene, and exists in World Space, continually facing the Main Camera. This makes it useful for displaying debug messages while play testing XR experiences.
